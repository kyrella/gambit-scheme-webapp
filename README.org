* Test Web App on Gambit Scheme

Every year I feel compelled to try building a web application with something exotic, such as Scheme!
Usually, this doesn't lead anywhere, but this time I actually made some progress. Ultimately, however, I ran out of time that I could spend on something so seemingly pointless. üî•

That said, I think there is still hope, so I decided to put this in a repository for... well, for future me, I guess.

So, here is the current progress:
+ It actually works! üôå
+ It avoids the typical Lisp/Scheme webapp rite of passage involving yet another custom SXML->DOM diffing implementation, instead using the [[https://github.com/AFASSoftware/maquette][Maquette]] runtime (a JS library).
+ And that's about it - it renders a couple of elements just to demonstrate that the Gambit JS target/FFI works and can handle two-way communication (i.e., event handlers function correctly).
+ There are no libs for anything webapp related because Gambit supports R7RS libs only and even so, it seems can't work with [[https://akkuscm.org/][Akku]].
+ Oh, almost forgot: it's a mere 8MB in size! üéÄ There is a gist mentioned in the Sources section below showing how a minimal runtime library can be created, but that approach didn't work for me, and I don't have any more time for this at the moment.
+ Gambit's documentation is a nightmare. I hope [[https://github.com/mighty-gerbils/gerbil][Gerbil Scheme]] adds a JS target one day.
